<h3>The internet is without a doubt the most important technological development in human history. Web3 and metaverse technologies expand the internet as we know it by introducing novel features and advancements. Metaverse will make use of all aspects of modern technology, including 3D, VR, AR, AI, blockchain, cloud computing, voice computing, ambient computing, and more.

Citi is the latest Wall Street business to give a positive prognosis for Web 3.0 and the Metaverse, terms used to depict a future internet vision centred on decentralised technologies and virtual worlds. Citi stated in a March 2022 research paper that the metaverse economy might have a total addressable market of up to $13 trillion and five billion people by 2030.</h3>

        As you probably know, the ICO (“Initial Coin Offering”) industry has been booming, and it’s completely reinventing the way new startups kickstart themselves. In fact, have a look at Wikipedia’s list of highest crowdfunding projects https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_highest-funded_crowdfunding_projects, and you’ll notice that blockchain projects absolutely dominate the list.

        Project Part 3: Create a Pako Token
        
        By creating a token and related contracts, you’ll also learn how to handle money sent to your contracts, which should come in handy if you want to create some kind of paid decentralized service in the future.
        
        Therefore, for the sake of this chapter, let’s imagine that our Pako DApp uses its own coin – the Pako Token. We will create two contracts – one for the token itself and one for the token crowd sale (the ICO).
        
        Now Create your own Pako ERC20 Token and deploy it on a testnet. The Token should be to use OpenZeppelin contracts. You will use the Hardhat development environment. Also, write at least twenty automated tests. We will be using Solidity and Typescript for development.
        
        Project Part 4: Develop Crowd Sale Contract
        
        This contract will be responsible for allowing users to exchange ETH for our Pako Token. In order to do that we need to set a price for our token (1 ETH = 100 Pako Token)
        
        Implement a payable buyToken() function.
        
        Emit a BuyTokens event that will log who’s the buyer, the amount of ETH sent and the amount of Token bought
        
        Transfer 75% of the Tokens to the Crowd Sale contract at deployment time. i.e. Right after the contract is deployed, we want the token contract to send 75% of our token supply to it. While 25% remain in our personal “owner” account.
        
        Transfer the ownership of the Crowd Sale contract (at deploy time) to our frontend address so that we are able to withdraw the ETH.
        
        You can use the openzeppelin crowd sale contracts https://docs.openzeppelin.com/contracts/4.x/crowdsales however you will have to update the code to the latest solidity version.
        
        Also write extensive tests, for example we will simply send a transaction of 1 ETH from a random account to the contract. After the transaction, we should expect the account to have received Pako, while the contract’s balance should have been reduced.
        
        Note: Before you get started writing the token contract we suggest you review access control https://docs.openzeppelin.com/contracts/4.x/access-control
        
        Project Part 5: Trying it with MetaMask
        
        While it’s always good to test your code, it’s often more satisfying to see the results of your work wrapped in a nice UI. Let’s see how we can deploy our contracts and get some Pako tokens into our MetaMask wallet!
        
        We start by running our deployment scripts for the test network so that the new token contracts are uploaded and deployed.
        
        When it’s done, take note of what addresses the contracts were uploaded to and copy it!
        
        Now head to MetaMask, and send a transaction of 1 ETH to the crowd sale contract address. If your MetaMask wallet doesn’t have any ethers, remember that you can use any faucet.
        
        After the transaction has been confirmed, you might be confused about why you can’t see any tokens in your wallet. It turns out that you need to manually add the token address in MetaMask in order to “register” it – after all, there are so many tokens out there, there’s no way MetaMask could list them all by default!
        
        To do this, open the side menu and click on the “Add token” button to get started:
        
        Once you’re on the token page, click on “Add custom token” and paste in the token contract’s address in the address field.
        
        After confirming that you want to add the token, you should be able to see your Pako balance right next to your ETH balance in the wallet. How cool!

    <h2>Quarter IV Web3 and Metaverse
        MV-361: Developing Planet-Scale Open Virtual and Augmented Metaverse Experiences</h2>
    <h3>Duration: 13 Weeks

        Course Description:
        
        The Web is the Metaverse. The metaverse requires an infrastructure that connects all of the metaverses so that we can travel between them. This is only achievable with open web-based metaverses. The internet and its browsers are magical. Federated but linked experiences connect pages, people, technology, businesses, standards, and nations. It’s unlike anything else. The metaverse should replicate the best qualities of the web - it should just be the web. We just have to extend online responsive design from mobile to desktop to 3D, Augmented Reality, and Virtual Reality. This course will teach you how to build the Open Social Spatial Web with WebXR and WebGPU technologies.
        
        Course Outline:
